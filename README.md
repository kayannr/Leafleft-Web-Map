The USGS (United States Geological Survey) is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day. This project creates a web map that displays the data gathered from the USGS website.

   The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. The [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page provides the URL of the JSON to pull in the data for the visualization.
